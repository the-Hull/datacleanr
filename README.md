`datacleanr` is a flexible and efficient tool for **interactive** data
cleaning, and is inherently interoperable, as it seamlessly integrates
into **reproducible** data analyses pipelines in `R`.

It can deal with nested **tabular**, as well as **spatial** and **time
series** data.

## Installation

The latest release on CRAN can be installed using:

``` r
install.packages("datacleanr")
```

You can install the development version of `datacleanr` with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("the-hull/datacleanr")
```

**If you are using macOS, please make sure you have `XQuartz` installed,
especially if you’ve recently updated your system.** **See these
instructions here: <https://CRAN.R-project.org/bin/macosx/>**

**In case the package installation fails due to a compilation error from `magick`, please try installing the dev headers for `magick` with
`sudo apt-get install libmagick++-dev`. Also see this [gh issue](https://github.com/the-Hull/datacleanr/issues/13).

## Design

`datacleanr` is developed using the [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)
package, and relies on informative summaries, visual cues and
interactive data selection and annotation. All data-altering operations
are documented, and converted to valid `R` code (**reproducible
recipe**), that can be copied, sent to an active `RStudio` script, or
saved to disk.

There are **four tabs** in the app for these tasks:

-   **Set-up & Overview**: define nesting structure based on (multiple)
    groups.
-   **Filtering**: use `R` expression to filter/subset data.
-   **Visual Cleaning and Annotating**: generate bivarirate (time
    series) plots and maps, as well as highlight and annotate individual
    observations. Cycle through nested groups to expedite exploration
    and cleaning. Histograms of original vs. ‘cleaned’ data can be
    generated.
-   **Extract**: generate reproducible recipe and define outputs.
    **`dcr_app` also returns all intermediate and final outputs
    invisibly to the active `R` session for later use (e.g. when batch
    processing)**

Note, maps require columns `lon` and `lat` (X and Y) in decimal degrees
in the data set to render.

## Additional features

-   **Grouping**: the grouping defined in the “Set-up and Overview” tab
    is carried forward through the app. These groups can be used to
    cycle through nested/granular data, and considerably speed up
    exploration and cleaning. These groups are also available for
    filtering (Filtering tab), where filter expressions can be scoped to
    group level (i.e. no groups, individual, all groups).
-   **Interoperability**: when a logical (`TRUE`\\`FALSE`) column named
    `.dcrflag` is present, corresponding observations are rendered with
    different symbols in plots and maps. Use this feature to validate or
    cross-check external quality control or outlier flagging methods.
-   **Batching**: If data sets are too large, or too deeply nested
    (e.g. individual, plot, site, region, etc.), we recommend a
    split-combine approach to expedite the processing.

``` r
# prepare data into species sub-sets
iris_split <- split(x = iris,
                    f = iris$Species)
# run for each species
dcr_iris <- lapply(iris_split, 
                   function(split){
                       datacleanr::dcr_app(split)
                   })
```

## Getting started

The documentation for (`?dcr_app()`) explains the basic use and all
features. Throughout the app, there are conveniently-placed help links
that provide details on features.

## Demonstration

Launch `datacleanr`’s interactive app with `dcr_app()`. The following
examples demonstrate basic use and highlight features across the four
app tabs.

### 1. Set-up & Overview

Define the grouping structure (used throughout app for scoping filters
and plotting), and generate an informative overview.

``` r
library(datacleanr)

# group by species
dcr_app(iris)
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-Hull/datacleanr/master/man/figures/readme_setup.gif" width = "1000" align = "center"/>

### 2. Filtering

Add/Remove filter statement boxes, and apply (valid) expressions -
either to the entire data set, or scoped to individual groups. Filtering
relies on `R` expressions passed to `dplyr::filter()`, so, for example,
valid statements for `iris` are:

``` r
    Species == 'setosa'
    Species %in% c('setosa','versicolor')
    Sepal.Width > quantile(Sepal.Width, 0.05)
```

Any function returning a logical vector (i.e. `TRUE`/`FALSE`), can be
employed here!

### 3. Visualizing and annotating

Interactive visualization allow seamless scrolling, panning and zooming
to select and annotate individual observations (or sections with
lasso/box select tool). Show and hide groups using the group selection
table (left) or the legend (right).

#### 3.1 General highlighting and annotating

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-Hull/datacleanr/master/man/figures/readme_select.gif" width = "1000" align = "center"/>

#### 3.2 Using `.dcrflag` to interface with external QA/QC

``` r
library(datacleanr)
library(dplyr)

iris_mod <- iris %>%
group_by(Species) %>%
  # .dcrflag provides additional visual cue in visualization tab
  # based on TRUE/FALSE 
mutate(.dcrflag = Sepal.Width < quantile(Sepal.Width, 0.05))


dcr_app(iris_mod)
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-Hull/datacleanr/master/man/figures/readme_select_dcrflag.gif" width = "1000" align = "center"/>

#### 3.3 Time Series

Any `numeric` or `POSIXct` column (in X or Y dimension) can be used to
visualize time series. Use the `Toggle Lines` button above the plot to
facilitate exploration.

**Example 1**:

``` r
library(dplyr)

dplyr::glimpse(treering)
tree_df <- data.frame(year = -6000:1979,
           val = treering)

# make synthetic data
tree_data <- list(tree_A = tree_df,
                  tree_B = tree_df %>% 
                      mutate(val = val + rnorm(nrow(.), 0.5, 0.2)),
                  tree_C = tree_df %>% 
                      mutate(val = val + rnorm(nrow(.), mean = -0.03, 0.1))) %>% 
    bind_rows(.id = "tree")

# group by tree and inspect
dcr_app(tree_data)
```

> (Note, selections are arbitrary and for demonstration only)

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-Hull/datacleanr/master/man/figures/readme_select_timeseries.gif" width = "1000" align = "center"/>

**Example 2**:

> No GIF

``` r
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
data("storms", package = "dplyr")

storms_mod <- storms %>% 
    mutate(timestamp = lubridate::ymd_h(paste(year, month, day, hour)))

# Group by name (198 groups)
# Check "Emily"
dcr_app(storms_mod)
```

#### 3.4 Spatial

Interactive maps rely on [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) for plotting.
Therefore, you will need to make an account, from which an access token
needs to be copied into your `.Renviron`
(e.g. `MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_copied_token`). A simple way to do this is
using the convenient `usethis` package to access the file:

``` r
usethis::edit_r_environ()
```

Select columns `lon` and `lat` for plotting to get started.

**Example 1**

``` r
library(datacleanr)
library(dplyr)

airport_data <- read.csv('https://plotly-r.com/data-raw/airport_locations.csv') %>%
    rename(lon = long)

# group by state
dcr_app(airport_data)
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-Hull/datacleanr/master/man/figures/readme_select_spatial.gif" width = "1000" align = "center"/>

**Example 2**

> No GIF

``` r
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
data("storms", package = "dplyr")


storms_mod <- storms %>% 
    rename(lon = long)

# Group by name (198 groups)
# Check "Bonnie"
dcr_app(storms_mod)
```

### 4. Extract (Reproducible Recipe)

All grouping, filtering and selections/annotations are translated to `R`
code, which can be sent to an `RStudio` script, copied to the clipboard,
or - when `dcr_app` is launched with a file path - save options are made
available. For large selections/annotations we recommend saving the
script separately, and sourcing it
(i.e. `source("your_datacleanr_script.R")`) during later analyses.

**Caution: When selections / annotations are greater than \~ 1000
points, it is recommended to use `datacleanr` with an `*.RDS` file (see
below). This is because the resulting Reproducible Recipe (script) can
slow down the RStudio IDE, if it has more than a few thousand lines.The
next version of `datacleanr` will allow choosing between script-only
recipes, and the option with an the intermediate file for storing
annotations. Both approaches with their current implementation are shown
shown below.**

**Example 1**

Launching with an object from `R`:

``` r
library(datacleanr)
dcr_app(iris)
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-Hull/datacleanr/master/man/figures/readme_extract.gif" width = "1000" align = "center"/>

And output from extract tab:

``` r
# datacleaning with datacleanr (0.0.1)
# ##------ Wed Oct 07 12:54:03 2020 ------##

library(dplyr)
library(datacleanr)

#  adding column for unique IDs;
iris$.dcrkey <- seq_len(nrow(iris))


iris <- dplyr::group_by(iris, Species)

#  stats and scoping level for filtering
filter_conditions <- structure(list(filter = "Sepal.Width > 2.7", grouping = list(NULL)), row.names = c(NA, 
    -1L), class = c("tbl_df", "tbl", "data.frame"))

#  applying (scoped) filtering by groups;
iris <- datacleanr::filter_scoped_df(dframe = iris, condition_df = filter_conditions)

#  observations from manual selection (Viz tab);
iris_outlier_selection <- structure(list(.dcrkey = c(15L, 16L, 19L, 34L), .annotation = c("", "", "", 
    "")), class = "data.frame", row.names = c(NA, -4L))

#  create data set with annotation column (non-outliers are NA);
iris <- dplyr::left_join(iris, iris_outlier_selection, by = ".dcrkey")

# remove comment below to drop manually selected obs in data set;
# iris  <- iris %>% dplyr::filter(is.na(.annotation))
```

**Example 2**

Launching with an `.RDS` from disk:

``` r
saveRDS(iris, file = "./testiris.Rds")

library(datacleanr)
dcr_app("./testiris.Rds")
```

## Examples:

### 1. Exploring soil respiration with **COSORE**:

**COSORE** is a community-driven soil respiration database, recently
introduced with a manuscript published
[here](https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15353) by Bond-Lamberty *et al.*. The
database provides soil respiration flux estimates, as well as meta data
across multiple data sets. Let’s explore!

``` r
remotes::install_github("bpbond/cosore")
library(dplyr)

# check data base info
db_info <- cosore::csr_database()
tibble::glimpse(db_info)

# grab one data set and explore in detail
dset <- "d20190409_ANJILELI"
anjilleli <- cosore::csr_dataset(dset)
tibble::glimpse(anjilleli$description)


datacleanr::dcr_app(anjilleli$data)
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-Hull/datacleanr/master/man/figures/readme_cosore_single.gif" width = "1000" align = "center"/>

**Explore sampling locations**:

``` r
# Check location info
db_info <- db_info %>%
    mutate(lon = CSR_LONGITUDE,
           lat = CSR_LATITUDE)
datacleanr::dcr_app(db_info)
```

> No GIF

**Explore nested data sets**:

``` r
# grab all data from ZHANG
zhang <- cosore::csr_table("data", c("d20190424_ZHANG_maple",
                                        "d20190424_ZHANG_oak")) %>%
  # adjust for grouping
  mutate(CSR_PORT = as.factor(CSR_PORT))

# group by CSR_DATASET and CSR_PORT
datacleanr::dcr_app(zhang)
```
